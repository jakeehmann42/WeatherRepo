# WeatherSearch API


## Description
With this website API the goal was to search for any city and be presented with
a daily forecast as a big container in the left column.
You will also be presented with a five day forecast below with a smaller height.
I built this API because i wanted a much easier presentation to read when results are brought up, also
depending how far may save storage.


## Installation
First create a repo in GitHub under your account,
Then clone that repo into a folder created specifically for this assignment,
After adding basic HTML and save your work on both VS code and GitHub,
You can start to check ig your website is showing up,
If NOT, make sure the root level is set to 'MASTER'


## Usage
When first brought to the site search for a city,
After hitting search you will be presented with two columns,
Inside those two columns is a daily forecast, and five day forecast.
